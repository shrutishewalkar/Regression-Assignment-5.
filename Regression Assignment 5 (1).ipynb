    "Ans: Elastic Net regression is a type of linear regression that combines the L1 and L2 regularization methods to overcome some of the limitations of each individual method. The L1 regularization method, also known as Lasso, helps in feature selection by shrinking the coefficients of less important variables to zero. On the other hand, the L2 regularization method, also known as Ridge, helps in handling multicollinearity by shrinking the coefficients of highly correlated variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to other regression techniques, such as linear regression, Lasso, and Ridge regression, Elastic Net regression has the advantage of being able to handle situations where there are many correlated predictor variables. It also provides a better balance between feature selection and handling multicollinearity, making it more suitable for high-dimensional datasets with many variables. However, Elastic Net regression is computationally more intensive than other regression techniques and requires careful tuning of its hyperparameters."

Cross-validation involves splitting the data into training and validation sets multiple times and training the model on the training set while evaluating its performance on the validation set. This process is repeated for different values of the regularization parameters, and the values that result in the best predictive performance are chosen.\n",

Regression imputation involves using other predictor variables to estimate the missing value.\n",
